CHANGES IN ES-6
---------------

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/rapid-es6-training/table-of-contents

COMPATIBILITY
* Modern browsers are 90% compatible
* Mobile os are not
* We will need to use compilers or transpilers like Babel


LET, CONST AND BLOCK SCOPE
* let is like var, but it does not have hoisting (it is not taken automatically to the beginning of the program).
* const declares constants. Once declared, we cannot change their value.
* every {block} has now its own scope: block variables are not accessible from outside the block.


ARROW FUNCTIONS
* "this input has this output"
* var getPrice = count => count * 10;  --- es equivalente a: function getPrice(count) { return count * 10;}
* if the function has a block, we need to use the return keyword.
