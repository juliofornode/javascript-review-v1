//'not defined', undefined and null

//'not defined': when we try to use a non-existent variable
console.log(x); //error: x is not defined

//undefined: the var is declared, but with no value
var y;
console.log(y); //error: y is undefined

//null: the var value has been set to null
var z = null;
console.log(z); //null


//some weird things in JS:
//undefined == null
