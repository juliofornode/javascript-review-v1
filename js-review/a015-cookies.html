COOKIES
-------
Cookies are small text files stored in your computer to remember you as user of a web page.
Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like username = John Doe.

When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request.
This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users.


CREATE A COOKIE
---------------
JavaScript can create, read, and delete cookies with the document.cookie property.

    document.cookie = "username=John Doe";

If you set a new cookie, older cookies are not overwritten. The new cookie is added to document.cookie

You can also add an expiry date (in UTC time). By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed:

    document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC";


With a path parameter, you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to.
By default, the cookie belongs to the current page.

    document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";


READ OR CHANGE A COOKIE
-----------------------
    var x = document.cookie;


If you want to find the value of one specified cookie, you must write a JavaScript
function that searches for the cookie value in the cookie string.


DELETE A COOKIE
---------------
Set the expires parameter to a passed date.
