//In ES5 there are 6 data types:
//5 primitives (string, number, boolean, null, undefined) and 1 non-primitive (object)


//we can use typeof or typeof() to get the data type of a JS element
//typeof(null) gets "object". This is a built-in error of JS
//typeof(myFunction) gets "function", which means "function object"
